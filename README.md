Using java's process and runtime classes. it's possible to make system commands 
from within your program. eventhough that limits java's portability as each system have different
system commands. 

its not that of a problem for android devices, which they all run a mod version of the linux kernel.

this is a demo of trying out these classes. familiarity with linux commands is expected.
